l5r-card-overlay is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle. 
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `~1.3.0`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.

Requires cards to be in `shared/5rdbcards/` named as `L5<l5rcode>.jpg`. For example, `A Fate Worse than Death` would be in that folder as `L5C01_95.jpg`. Note: Due to the fashion in which fiveringsdb.com stores card URLs with alternate art, the first found valid image is used.

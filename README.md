netrunner-card-overlay is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle. 
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `~0.9.9`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.

Requires cards to be in `shared/netrunnercards/` named as `<nrdbcode>.png`. For example, Maw would be in that folder as `12002.png`.
